# Shopblocks PHP Developer Test: Pet-é-dex 

## Teo Notes
Changes:
- Removed key from key.example for security reasons
- Cache the api results to increase speed and responsiveness
- Used Guzzle instead of Http
- Kept Controller clean by using Service instead
- Redirect to Http.Cat if it returns 404
- Use services.php

Things i would add given more time: 
- Query the api directly instead of filtering the blade file
- Create more tests for the app
- Add pagination
- Use Vue instead
- Make it prettier



## Introduction

Your task is to create a **Pet-é-dex** web-based encyclopedia for either dogs or cats. You can choose between:
- [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)
- [The Dog API](https://thedogapi.com/)

This project will provide users with the ability to search for and display information about specific breeds, based on the selected API.

## Project Requirements

To complete the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Docker**
- **Git**

The front-end of the application **must be built using Bootstrap** to ensure a responsive and clean design. Feel free to add custom styling as needed.

### Additional Requirements

- You will be provided with a skeleton Laravel application.
- You must fork this repository to your own public GitHub account to complete the test.
- We recommend spending no more than two hours on this test but we expect for senior developers this will take around an hour.

## Test Requirements

You are required to build a **Pokédex-style web app** (Pet-é-dex) that allows users to search for and display information about pet breeds, using your chosen API.

- Api keys will be provided in the example .env file within the laravel application.
- The API is rate-limited, so be cautious when making requests.
- You must implement a search functionality to filter breeds by name.

### Key Features:

1. **Main Pet-é-dex Page**:
    - Display a full list of pets fetched from the API.
    - Provide a search form to allow users to filter the list by pet breed name.

2. **Pet Overview Page**:
    - When a pet breed is clicked from the main page, redirect to a detailed overview page.
    - Display pet information such as image, breed name, temperament, life expectancy, and other relevant data.

3. **Navigation**:
    - Include a navigation link to go back to the main page from the Pet Overview page.

## API Information 

The api documentation can be found here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5578104/RWgqUxxh. The api is the same for
both cats and dogs. So the only difference if the url being either thecatapi.com or thedogapi.com.

## Getting Setup

To get started clone the repo, once cloned run `make setup` in the root of the clone repo this will setup the environment for
you.

## Submission

Once you’ve completed the test:
- Ensure you have forked the repository.
- No pull/merge request is required.
- Provide a link to your forked repository for review.

## Notes

- We’re more interested in **how you approach the task** rather than expecting a fully polished product. Focus on functionality above styling but the front-end should be easy to use and responsive.
- Consider **performance, security and rate limits** when making API requests.
